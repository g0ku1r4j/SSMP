; 8086 program to subtract two 16-bit numbers (with carry)
; The numbers to be added are stored in AX and BX registers
; A carry is generated when 1st number < 2nd number. In such case, the final result is the 2's complement of the result
; CX is used to store carry before result is stored in memory
; Carry signifies sign bit when stored along with result
; The final result is stored in a word reserved in the memory (RESULT)
; Carry is stored in the next word succeeding to RESULT

ASSUME CS: CODE, DS: DATA

DATA SEGMENT
    NUM1 DW 0FFFFH          ; First operand
    NUM2 DW 09876H          ; Second operand
    RESULT DW 01 DUP(?)		; Word of memory reserved for result
DATA ENDS

CODE SEGMENT
START:
	MOV AX, DATA            ; Initialize data segment
	MOV DS, AX

	MOV AX, NUM1            ; Move NUM1 to AX register
	MOV BX, NUM2            ; Move NUM2 to BX register

	CLC                     ; Clear carry flag
	XOR CX, CX              ; Clear CX register

	SUB AX, BX              ; Subtract the operands, result is stored in AX
	JNC NEXT                ; Jump to NEXT if no carry is generated
	INC CX                  ; CF is set since 1st number < 2nd number and CX is incremented to signify a carry to store it in result
	NOT AX					; Result in AX must be complemented to get actual magnitude
	ADD AX, 0001H			; Adding 1 to get two's complement
NEXT:
	MOV DI, OFFSET RESULT   ; Move offset of RESULT to DI
	MOV [DI], AX            ; Store result at memory address in DI
	INC DI                  ; DI before this instruction points to the offset of RESULT. A word beginning from this location is already occupied for 16-bit result
	INC DI                  ; To store the carry at the next word, INC is done twice since incrementation is done byte-wise
	MOV [DI], CX            ; Store carry
	
	MOV AH, 4CH             ; Return to DOS prompt
	INT 21H
